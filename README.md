# React + TypeScript + Vite

## About this repository

This template provides a minimal setup to start building a React app with Vite and TypeScript. Since lack of code-formatting and linting can be annoying, I added Biome as a way to keep code pretty and consistent.

## How to use the template

Easiest way is to create your own Github repository based on this template repository. [THIS LINK](https://github.com/new?template_name=vite-react-ts-template&template_owner=Andersclark) should do it.

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Start development server
